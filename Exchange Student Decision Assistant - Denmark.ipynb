You want to have a year abroad, and your fondness has landed on Denmark. In Denmark, there are three major universities in three major cities, which offers exchange students the possibility to study Medicine. Namely, University of Aarhus (located in Jutland), University of Southern Denmark (located in Funen) and the University of Copenhagen (located in Zealand).\n\nIf you as an exchange student has no inherent preference towards either of the three universities, and that all three universities are equally renowned and offer the same level of education, how do you choose which university to attend?\n\nThis project seeks to solve the above problem, by helping interested exchange students in a way of assessing which area provides the most of their favorite three interests and make them able to select a university and location to study in Denmark based on these."
